Abstract: In this work, we presents a novel approach for predicting the effective properties of composite materials by integrating multiscale homogenization techniques with deep learning. High-fidelity datasets are generated using Miltonâ€™s method and asymptotic homogenization through finite element simulations, capturing material behavior across scales from the nanoscale to the macroscale. A key contribution of this study is the development of an advanced multiscale homogenization model that accounts for heterogeneous property distributions within the representative volume element at the mesoscale, enabling more realistic and accurate material representation.
The generated datasets are used to train multilayer perceptron models that achieve high predictive accuracy and strong generalization across both similar and dissimilar inclusion scenarios, while significantly reducing computational cost compared to conventional methods for predicting the effective properties of composite materials, specifically the effective thermal conductivity of hybrid aerogels. Additionally, the surrogate models show strong extrapolation capability, providing physically consistent predictions beyond the training domain. This scalable and robust framework offers a powerful tool for data-driven material design and can be readily extended to predict other effective properties.
